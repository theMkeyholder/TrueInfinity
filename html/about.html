				<h2>How to Play</h2>
			</div>
			
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Antimatter</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Antimatter is the primary currency in
					True Infinity, as True Infinity is a
					knockoff of Infinite Layers (but with
					more content) which is a knockoff of
					Antimatter Dimensions. Antimatter is
					used to buy stuff. The objective of
					this game is to get so much antimatter
					that the games big number library can't
					work with it anymore. At this point you
					can say that you beat the game. At the
					moment that would take you approximately
					{10, {10, 16}, 1000} (BAN) years to do 
					so good luck!!
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Dimensions</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Dimensions are what produce your resources
					in True Infinity. The First Dimension produces
					antimatter, the Second Dimension produces First
					Dimensions, the Third produces Seconds and so
					on. After 10 dimensions, the game only stores
					three dimensions, this is to let the game handle
					1e308th dimensions. I then used a mathematical
					approximation using binomial coefficients to
					approximate the production of first dimensions.
					After you get to e1e6 antimatter, all dimensions
					get a <strong><em>huge</em></strong> boost to
					their multipliers.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Max All</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Max All is your best friend. It allows you to buy
					max many dimensions at once, and unlock more dimensions
					far more quickly, letting you buy several thousands,
					or billions of dimensions at a time. You can automate
					the Max All later in the game.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Prestige</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Once you reach 1.79e308 antimatter you will be
					able to infinity. This will give you a certain
					number of infinity points, set your antimatter
					to 10 and delete all your dimension, but you'll
					be able to get way further in the future :) Once
					you reach 1.79e308 infinity points you can go to
					eternity, once you get 1.79e308 eternity points
					you can reality, etc.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Points</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Upon prestiging you will get some points for that
					prestige layer. You can use these points to buy
					that layers dimensions. Same thing as for regular
					dimensions. First makes power, Second makes First,
					etc.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Power</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					A layers dimensions make that layers power. Power
					provides a multiplier boost to all layers below it.
					For the first layer below it, the boost is equal to
					the amount of power. For the second layer and further
					layers down, the boost is huge in comparison, like
					double exponentiation huge!
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Automation</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Once you Celerity (7th layer of prestige) you unlock
					the automation tab. You can then spend that layers
					points on automating the max-all button and getting
					automatic pretige points based on the points of that
					layer. Each game tick (20 times a second) it gives
					you 1e6th the amount of points you would've got if
					you'd prestiged at that point. The prestige automation
					is far more expensive than the max all automation.
					Prestige automation does nothing on the highest layer
					you have.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Automation of Automation</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Once you reach eee100 antimatter, you can automate
					the process of auto-max all and auto-prestige. This
					lets you click your way to high prestige layers, and
					automatically be able to max all for the higer layers.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Auto Prestige</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					Once you reach P200 (the 200th prestige layer) you can
					unlock Auto-Prestige (seperate from Auto-Prestige Gain
					mentioned above) for eee500 antimatter. Auto-Prestige 
					unlocks new layers for you. 
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<button class='toggle sbb blue half'>Bulk Prestige</button>
				<div class='div hidden'>
					You can reach the next level of auto prestige for
					eee3000 antimatter, at this level the auto prestige
					unlocks 10 layers at a time. The next level costs
					eee8000 and unlocks 100 layers at a time. Level 4
					costs eee50000 and unlocks layers at 1.1 times the
					layer number of your highest layer. Level 5 is very
					powerful and costs eeee10 antimatter, but unlocks
					layers at your highest layer to the power of 1.1;
